# Redress / LOB taxonomy for CFPB Wells Fargo complaints.
# Designed for a large customer redress function: LOBs = who owns the complaint and is measured on it.
# CFPB "product" is consumer-facing; we map to internal redress LOBs and optional product_line refinement.
# Customize lob_redress and product_line to match your org structure.

# --- Redress LOBs (lines of business that own complaint handling) ---
# These are the canonical groupings for redress reporting. "Money transfer" is NOT its own LOB;
# it is a product/channel under Consumer Banking (payments / money movement).
# Order below is typical for executive reporting (volume / risk).

lob_redress:
  Consumer Banking:       # Deposits, checking, savings, branch, payments (wires, ACH, Zelle, etc.)
  Credit Card:            # Card lending, rewards, disputes
  Mortgage:               # Origination, servicing, foreclosure / loss mitigation
  Auto:                   # Vehicle loan or lease
  Personal Lending:       # Personal loans, student loans, payday/title if applicable; debt management
  Debt Collection:       # Recovery / collections operations
  Credit Reporting & Disputes:   # Furnishing, FCRA, dispute handling
  Other:                  # Catch-all
